Automatic L3vpn Multivendor with Ansible and NAPALM (IOS,XR,Junos,etc)

Automatically create and deploy an L3VPN service (template creation, configuration and validation that the network is in the way its configuration was planned and that there are no floating configurations), the l3vpn service model is loaded into an ansible playbook and based on The same model creates a template of configurations for each type of equipment involved in the service and then through NAPALM-Ansible library deploys the service to multiple network devices, in the example shown in the demonstration video on YouTube (I leave link below) an automated deployment of l3vpn to devices with IOS, XR, JunOS is shown and it is validated that they announce prefixes, BGP is used as PE-CE protocol, but any type of IGP can be used in the same way as PE-CE.

Technology stack

Python 3.x, Ansible 2.7 or higher, it can be run on windows as long as ubuntu as WSL is installed and from there run it

Status:

Only one version already tested and validated in emulated enviroment (EVE-NG with multivendor ISP Topology, see the video link below)

Use Case Description

Service providers that wish to implement l3vpn services in an automated way, with support for multivendor, generates a standard model for the deployment of the service, in the same way this tool serves to the companies that have this service and require to automate the configuration to many devices saving time in deployment and validation.

Installation

Ubuntu 18.04 o any Distribution of Linux with support to Python3 and Ansible2.7 or higher (support with Ansible 2.9)
it can be run on windows as long as ubuntu as WSL is installed and from there run it (recomended)

Steps to install in Ubuntu workstation (automation station) 
sudo apt-get install python3
sudo apt-get install ansible
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv 
mkdir l3vpn-automation
python3.6 -m venv venv-l3vpn
source venv-l3vpn/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/Raul-Flores/L3VPN-SV.git
pip install requirements.txt

Configuration
you have to go to the main directory, some PEs devices are found as an example you can substitute their names and associate them in the file etc/hosts in your linux the name with the IP address you need.


example:
 cat /etc/hosts
# This file is automatically generated by WSL based on the Windows hosts file:
(output ommited for brevety)
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
